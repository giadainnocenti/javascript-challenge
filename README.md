In this challenge, all the UFO sighting of 2010 were collected in a [JSON dataset](./UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js). It is necessary to make them available online so that everybody is able to access them in an easy and filtrable way. \
They are displayed on the web-page by using Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
# [LEVEL 1](./UFO-level-1/)
In the folder [static](./UFO-level-1/static/), the [javascript code](./UFO-level-1/static/js/app.js) and the [javascript datased](./UFO-level-1/static/js/data.js) are reported in the folder [js](./UFO-level-1/static/js/) while the webpage style is in the file [style](./UFO-level-1/static/css/style.css) in the folder [css](./UFO-level-1/static/css/). \
